# ParetoTracer

## Introduction
The Pareto Tracer (PT) is a predictor-corrector method for the numerical treatment of sufficiently smooth multi-objective optimization 
problems (MOP). The algorithm performs a continuation along the set of (local) solutions of a given MOP with ùëò objectives and can cope 
with equality and box constraints. 
For the detailed explanations of the algorithms behind the PT we refer to:

## Getting Started 
This implementation of PT was developed using MATLAB 2015. The code is organized in different packages depending on the scope. 
The main package is called **`pt`** which stands for Pareto Tracer. This contains the main entry point to the algorithm: the function 
**`pt.trace`**. 
Below there is a basic example on how to call this function. 

**`[result, stats, EXITFLAG] = pt.trace(objfun, x0, [], lb, ub, lincon, nonlcon, multfun, opts);`**

Each one of the parameters is explained later in detail. For now, another key function is introduced: **`pt.minimize`**. This function is 
utilized for the corrector phase of the algorithm. For the unconstrained case, it coincides with the Newton method proposed by 
**Fliege et al. in [3]**. A modification was proposed by **Mart√≠n et al. in [1]** to handle equality and box constraints. The current 
implementation of the **`pt.minimize`** function follows these instructions. A basic example on how to call this function is given below.

**`[result, stats, EXITFLAG] = pt.minimize(objfun, x0, [], lb, ub, lincon, nonlcon, multfun, opts);`**
