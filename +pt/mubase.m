% Computes the mu vectors corresponding to an orthonormal basis of the 
% tangent space to the Pareto front at the current iteration point.
% It will compute (nobj - 1) vectors of size nobj.
% The components of mu will sum up to zero.
% If force is true, the vectors mu will be re-computed even if they are not 
% empty.

% Assumes that all function values it1.fx, it1.ax, it1.aeqx, it.cx,
% it1.ceqx are already computed.
% Assumes that all objective and nonlinear constraint Jacobians it1.Jx, 
% it1.Jcx, it1.Jceqx are already computed.
% Assumes that the Lagrange multipliers w are already computed.
