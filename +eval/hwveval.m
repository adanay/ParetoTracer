function [Hwvx, Hwvcount, Hwvundef] = hwveval(Hwv, x, w, v, iswarning, opts)
% Vectorized Hessian multiply function evaluation.
% Hwv = (H1 * w1 + H2 * w2 + ... + Hnobj * wnobj) * v.
% Each row of x is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% Each row of w is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% Each row of v is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% x, w, and v must have the same no of individuals or only one (in order to be repeated).
% iswarning defines whether to display a warning or an error if the
% Hessian value is undefined. The Hessian value will be checked only if 
% opts.FunValCheck is true.
% opts are the optimization options.
%
% The result is always of size (m x n) even if m = 1.
