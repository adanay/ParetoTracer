% Vectorized Jacobian multiply function evaluation.
% wJ = w' * J.
% If wJ is empty, it will perform the multiplication.
% If J is also empty, it will use finite differences (FD).
% Each row of x is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% Each row of w is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% x and w must have the same no of individuals or only one (in order to be repeated).
% iswarning defines whether to display a warning or an error if the
% Jacobian value is undefined. The Jacobian value will be checked only if 
% opts.FunValCheck is true. I.e., if opts.FunValCheck is true and wJ(x) or 
% J(x) is undef, then
% + iswarning = true implies that a warning will be displayed and the
% Jacobian will be computed by FD (the objective function must be available).
% + iswarning = false implies that an error will be thrown.
% forcejac will force one evaluation of the Jacobian to be returned in Jx 
% even if wJ was passed and evaluated.
% opts are the optimization options.
%
% The result is always of size (m x n) even if m = 1.
% fx (if entered) is assumed to be of size (m x obj) even if m = 1 
% (after being calculated using one of the vec eval functions).
% wfx (if entered) is assumed to be of size (m x 1) even if m = 1 
% (after being calculated using one of the vec eval functions).
% Jx (if entered) is assumed to be of size (m x obj x n) even if m = 1 
% (after being calculated using one of the vec eval functions).
