function [Jvx, Jvcount, Jvundef,...

% Vectorized Jacobian multiply function evaluation.
% Jv = J * v.
% If Jv is empty, it will perform the multiplication.
% Each row of x is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% Each row of v is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% x and v must have the same no of individuals or only one (in order to be repeated).
% iswarning defines whether to display a warning or an error if the
% Jacobian value is undefined. The Jacobian value will be checked only if 
% opts.FunValCheck is true.
% forcejac will force one evaluation of the Jacobian to be returned in Jx 
% even if Jv was passed and evaluated.
% opts are the optimization options.
%
% The result is always of size (m x nobj) even if m = 1.
% The result of Jv(x) is assumed to be (nobj x 1) if m = 1.
% Jx (if entered) is assumed to be of size (m x obj x n) even if m = 1 
% (after being calculated using one of the vec eval functions).
