% Vectorized Hessian multiply function evaluation.
% vH = [v' * H1; v' * H2; ...; v' * Hnobj].
% If vH is empty, it will perform the multiplication.
% If H is also empty, the Hessian will be approximated to the identity matrix.
% Each row of x is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% Each row of v is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% x and v must have the same no of individuals or only one (in order to be repeated).
% iswarning defines whether to display a warning or an error if the
% Hessian value is undefined. The Hessian value will be checked only if 
% opts.FunValCheck is true. I.e., if opts.FunValCheck is true and vH(x) or 
% H(x) is undef, then
% + iswarning = true implies that a warning will be displayed and the
% Hessian will be approximated to the identity matrix.
% + iswarning = false implies that an error will be thrown.
% forcehess will force one evaluation of the Hessian to be returned in Hx 
% even if vH was passed and evaluated.
% formident will force the formation of the identity to be returned in Hx 
% if it is approximated. Otherwise Hx will be empty (but known to be the 
% identity if Happrox is true).
% opts are the optimization options.
%
% The result is always of size (m x nobj x n) even if m = 1.
% Hx (if entered) is assumed to be of size (m x n x n x nobj) even if m = 1 
% (after being calculated using one of the vec eval functions).
