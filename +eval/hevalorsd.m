function [Hx, Hcount, Hundef, Happrox] = hevalorsd(H, x, nobj, iswarning, formident, opts)
% Vectorized Hessian function evaluation.
% If H is empty, the Hessian will be approximated to the identity matrix.
% Each row of x is considered an individual to be evaluated.
% iswarning defines whether to display a warning or an error if the
% Hessian value is undefined. The Hessian value will be checked only if 
% opts.FunValCheck is true. I.e., if opts.FunValCheck is true and H(x) is 
% undef, then
% + iswarning = true implies that a warning will be displayed and the
% Hessian will be approximated to the identity matrix.
% + iswarning = false implies that an error will be thrown.
% formident will force the formation of the identity to be returned in Hx 
% if it is approximated. Otherwise Hx will be empty (but known to be the 
% identity if Happrox is true).
% opts are the optimization options.
%
% The result is always of size (m x n x n x nobj) even if m = 1.
% The result of H(x) is assumed to be (n x n x nobj) if m = 1.
