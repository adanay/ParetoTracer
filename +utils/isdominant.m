function [dominant] = isdominant(y1, y2)
% Defines the Pareto optimality regarding minimization.
% y1 and y2 are vectors.
% For simplicity, they must be row vectors of size (m x n) where m is the
% number of individuals and n is the number of variables.
% Returns true if y1 dominates y2 and false otherwise.
