function [contained] = cellcontains(c, r, x, lb, ub)
% Determines whether or not a point belongs to a cell.
%
% c is the center of the cell.
% r is the radius of the cell.
% x is the point to verify. For simplicity, x is assumed to be a row vector
% or a matrix of size (m x n) where m is the number of individuals and n is
% the number of variables.
% lb and ub are vectors that represent the box constraints.
%
% Returns true if the point belongs to the cell or false otherwise.
