function [c, r, inserted, index] = recover(tree, depth, x, lb, ub, index)
% Inserts the covering cell of a point into the tree as a leaf.
%
% tree is a binary tree that represents a partition of the space. The
% smallest partitions are called cells. Each leaf of the tree represents an
% existent cell.  
% depth is the number of subdivision iterations (depth of the tree).
% Initially make tree = scells.treenode for an empty tree.
% x is the point to insert. x must be a vector. 
% lb and ub are vectors that represent the box constraints.
% index is the index of x in an external list.
%
% Returns the center and radius of the covering cell of x.
% Also returns inserted = true if the covering cell of x was inserted, and
% inserted = false if the cell was not inserted because it was already in
% the tree.
% If the cell was already in the tree, returns the corresponding index in 
% an external list.
