% Attempts to determine whether there already exists a point close to x. It  
% is important to note that only points contained in the neighboring cells  
% of x will be considered, i.e., it is assumed e < r, where r is the radius   
% of the cells. If a neighbor point of x belongs to the e-ball of x, its  
% corresponding cell will be returned (if there is a point in the same cell 
% of x, the cell of x will be returned as in scells.treecontains). 
% Note that since the number of neighbor cells grow exponentially with n,
% the algorithm may consider to check only neighbors in coordinate 
% directions.

% tree is a binary tree that represents a partition of the space. The
% smallest partitions are called cells. Each leaf of the tree represents an
% existent cell.
% depth is the number of subdivision iterations (depth of the tree).
% list is an external list that contains the existent points (whose 
% covering cells are represented by a leaf of the tree).
% x is the point to consider whether or not is alone in the neighborhood.
% e is the neighborhood radius.
% lb and ub are vectors that represent the box constraints.
